# mcp-workshop

This workshop provides a comprehensive guide to building both MCP ([Model Context Protocol][1]) servers and clients using the [Go programming language][2]. You will learn how to leverage MCP to streamline your workflow and enhance your development environment.

## Using .vscode/mcp.json

The `.vscode/mcp.json` file provides configuration for MCP-related development within VS Code, allowing you to register servers and supply required credentials (such as API keys) in a unified place. This file enables easy integration and switching between different MCP server endpoints and credential sets.

### Structure

- **inputs**: Prompts the user for required values, such as API keys, when a workspace is opened. For example:
  - `perplexity-key` â€“ Stores your Perplexity API Key securely as a password input.

- **servers**: Defines known MCP server connections (by name), including protocol, endpoint, and headers if necessary. Examples in the default file:
  - `default-stdio-server` â€“ Connects to a local MCP server via stdio using the `mcp-server` command.
  - `default-http-server` â€“ Connects to a remote MCP server over HTTP, passing an authorization header as required.
  - `default-oauth-server`, `proxy-server-01`, `proxy-server-02` â€“ Additional HTTP(S) servers, with or without custom headers and endpoints.

#### Example (`.vscode/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "perplexity-key",
      "description": "Perplexity API Key",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "default-stdio-server": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "mcp-server",
      "args": ["-t", "stdio"]
    },
    "default-http-server": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer 1234567890"
      }
    }
    // ... more server entries ...
  }
}
```

### Usage

1. Place your `.vscode/mcp.json` in the root or `.vscode/` directory of your workspace.
2. Add or modify the `inputs` to include any required user-provided secrets.
3. Configure the `servers` block with relevant endpoints for each service you want to register. You can specify server type (`stdio` or `http`), commands, arguments, URLs, and headers (such as authentication tokens).
4. When opening the workspace, VS Code and supported MCP extensions or tools will prompt for required inputs and use these server connections for MCP operations.

For further customization or advanced scenarios, edit the file to register new endpoints or provide different credentials. This centralized configuration streamlines connection management and enhances development efficiency.

## MCP Inspector

[The MCP Inspector][01] is a developer tool designed for testing and debugging MCP servers. Similar to Postman, it enables you to send requests to MCP servers and view their responses. This tool is invaluable for developers working with MCP, providing a streamlined workflow for server interaction and troubleshooting.

## OAuth in MCP

The following diagrams illustrate the OAuth flow within MCP, including the sequence of communication between each role.

![oauth](./images/oauth-flow-01.png)

Sequence diagram showing communication with each role separately.

For more information on OAuth in MCP, refer to the [Let's fix OAuth in MCP][3] or the [MCP Authorization][4] documentation.

[3]: https://aaronparecki.com/2025/04/03/15/oauth-for-model-context-protocol
[4]: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization

The expected flow for obtaining a valid access token via OAuth is depicted in the [MCP Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization#authorization-flow-steps).  For convenience, we've embedded a copy of the authorization flow below.  Please study it carefully as the remainder of this document is written with this flow in mind.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as User-Agent (Browser)
    participant C as Client
    participant M as MCP Server (Resource Server)
    participant A as Authorization Server

    C->>M: MCP request without token
    M->>C: HTTP 401 Unauthorized with WWW-Authenticate header
    Note over C: Extract resource_metadata URL from WWW-Authenticate

    C->>M: Request Protected Resource Metadata
    M->>C: Return metadata

    Note over C: Parse metadata and extract authorization server(s)<br/>Client determines AS to use

    C->>A: GET /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server
    A->>C: Authorization server metadata response

    alt Dynamic client registration
        C->>A: POST /register
        A->>C: Client Credentials
    end

    Note over C: Generate PKCE parameters
    C->>B: Open browser with authorization URL + code_challenge
    B->>A: Authorization request
    Note over A: User authorizes
    A->>B: Redirect to callback with authorization code
    B->>C: Authorization code callback
    C->>A: Token request + code_verifier
    A->>C: Access token (+ refresh token)
    C->>M: MCP request with access token
    M-->>C: MCP response
    Note over C,M: MCP communication continues with valid token
```

> [!NOTE]
> Dynamic Client Registration is NOT supported by Remote MCP Server at this time.

## MCP Vulnerabilities

The following are some known vulnerabilities in MCP implementations:

![vulnerabilities](./images/vulnerabilities.gif)

- Command Injection (Impact: Moderate ğŸŸ¡)
- Tool Poisoning (Impact: Severe ğŸ”´)
- Open Connections via SSE (Impact: Moderate ğŸŸ )
- Privilege Escalation (Impact: Severe ğŸ”´)
- Persistent Context Misuse (Impact: Low, but risky ğŸŸ¡)
- Server Data Takeover/Spoofing (Impact: Severe ğŸ”´)

For more information, refer to the [MCP Vulnerabilities][11].
