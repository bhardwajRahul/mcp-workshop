## MCP Inspector

The MCP Inspector is a developer tool designed for testing and debugging MCP servers. Similar to Postman, it enables you to send requests to MCP servers and view their responses. This tool is invaluable for developers working with MCP, providing a streamlined workflow for server interaction and troubleshooting.

- Command Injection (Impact: Moderate ðŸŸ¡)
- Tool Poisoning (Impact: Severe ðŸ”´)
- Open Connections via SSE (Impact: Moderate ðŸŸ )
- Privilege Escalation (Impact: Severe ðŸ”´)
- Persistent Context Misuse (Impact: Low, but risky ðŸŸ¡)
- Server Data Takeover/Spoofing (Impact: Severe ðŸ”´)

For more information, refer to the [MCP Vulnerabilities][11].
