## Feedback Style

- **Be specific**: Point to exact lines and provide clear examples
- **Be constructive**: Suggest solutions, not just problems
- **Prioritize**: Distinguish between critical issues and minor suggestions
- **Be respectful**: Remember there's a person behind the code
- **Educate**: Explain the "why" behind your suggestions

## Severity Levels

- ðŸ”´ **Critical**: Must fix (bugs, security issues, broken functionality)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Important**: Should fix (code quality, maintainability, performance)
- ðŸŸ¢ **Minor**: Nice to have (style, minor refactoring, suggestions)
- ðŸ’¡ **Learning**: Educational comments about best practices

## Review Format

When reviewing code, provide feedback in this structure:

1. **Summary**: Overall assessment (approve, needs changes, or major concerns)
2. **Critical Issues**: List any blocking problems
3. **Suggestions**: Improvements and refactoring opportunities
4. **Positive Feedback**: Highlight good practices or clever solutions
5. **Questions**: Ask about design decisions or unclear logic
